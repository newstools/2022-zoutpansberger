Family and friends learned with great sadness of the passing away of former Louis Trichardt resident Mr Charles Frederick Stopford. Charles, lovingly also known as Charlie, Shumba (Lion) or Papa, passed away peacefully on 3 February at home, surrounded by his loved ones. He was 89 years old. Charles moved to Louis Trichardt in 2010 and then, a year later, moved to his daughter Ivy and son-in-law Warren Scholtz's farm, Mabalabala Ranch, situated between Waterpoort and Alldays. “He was a talented carpenter, loved tending his garden and being on the farm. He was always friendly, up for good banter and loved by all who met him. He was a loving brother, father, grandfather and great-grandfather,” said the family. Charles will be greatly missed and will live on in the memories of his sister Denny, daughters Ivy, Portia and Julie, his sons-in-law Warren, Christo and Dirk, his grandchildren Josh, Keagan, Cortney, Nicola, Matthew, Amy, Anita, Rogan and Damon, his great-grandchildren Harper and Zanroux, the brethren at the Church of Christ, the staff at Mabalabala Ranch and Sophie. A memorial service will be held to celebrate his life on Saturday, 19 February at 14:00 at the Church of Christ, Mabalabala Ranch. His family would like to thank Dr Emil Gaigher for his excellent care, great compassion, and support.
