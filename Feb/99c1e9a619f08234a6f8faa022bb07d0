The former deputy director of the Kutama Sinthumule correctional facility (SACM) outside Louis Trichardt, Clement Raphalalani (57), appeared in the Giyani Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday, 17 February, and was fined R100 000 or face 10 years in jail for corruption. He was also found guilty on other related corruption charges and sentenced to a R70 000 fine or 8 years imprisonment. The co-accused in the case, a company called Clemenson Carriers, that was tried as a juristic person, was found guilty of corruption and fined R150 000. Clemenson Carriers was also deregistered. “Between 2017 and 2018, Raphalalani in his professional capacity as Deputy Director (Procurement Officer) at Kutama Sinthumule correctional facility connived with his co-accused Thabo Makamane, who was also a Deputy Director at the facility, to award tenders to different companies without following due processes,” said Limpopo Hawk’s spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke in a press release following the sentencing of Raphalalani. Raphalalani and his co accused, who included representatives of three companies namely Clemenson Carriers, Penson Manufacturing and Vhalenda Zwashu, were arrested during a sting operation by the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation team in December 2018. The accused (Raphalalani) was previously convicted for corruption that also involved the facility and ordered to pay back R569 500 by the Giyani Specialised Commercial Crimes court. The company Clemenson Carriers was ordered to pay back R369 380. “The facility has suffered a loss of R18 million due to these illegal activities. The other outstanding accused persons including Makamane and the juristic persons are yet to be sentenced,” said Maluleke.
