The SPCA Louis Trichardt’s annual Jailed & Bailed fundraiser exceeded all expectations this year, with a record amount of R150 000 being raised. “I have no words! Not just have all previous records been smashed, but every single Jailbird made bail this year!” said local SPCA spokesperson Alicia Thomas. Thomas said that this year’s “jailbirds” has been totally amazing. “There have been healthy competition, comradery, support and we even had some jailbirds paying money in for fellow jailbirds to help reach our goals,” said Alicia. The R150 000 cash injection could not have come at a better time for the local SPCA. “Just last week we got the devastating news that our Lotto application has been put on hold and that we will only be able to reapply in April; terrible news for an SPCA that relies solely on fundraising and donations,” said Alicia. This year’s top jailbird was Rampie, and his dog Mila, with a record amount of R31 700 raised. For his effort, Rampie won a relaxing week at the ATKV Eiland Spa. In second place was Sheetal, and her Pug Luna. They raised R20 901. “For quite some time they were leading the pack and these two surely know a lot of people and are clearly loved by many. They had the most payments of all the jailbirds,” said Alicia. In third place was Alicia herself, and her pet pig Charlotte, with R20 800, just missing out on second place. In total, 13 jailbirds and their pets competed this year. “To our jailbirds - thank you, thank you, thank you! These two small words will never be enough. You have no idea what your efforts mean to us and our animals; because of you, we can breathe a bit easier for a while,” said Alicia. Alicia also thanked their sponsor, ATKV Eiland Spa, for their support and spoiling their winners with such an amazing prize.
