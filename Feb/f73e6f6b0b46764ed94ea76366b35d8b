Young Louis Trichardt athlete Kailey Botes has caused a stir on the local athletics scene by setting two hurdles records in her age group and then going on to break both records within two weeks of each other. Home schooler (or rather online schooler) Kailey is a member of the local IsAbility Sport Club for both para-athletes and able-bodied athletes. On 4 February, she took part in the athletics meet at Merensky High School. Other attending schools were Louis Trichardt High School, Stanford Lake College, Ridgeway College, Eric Louw High School and Northern Academy. During this event, she not only made herself proud but also her coach, Gideon Joubert, when she ran the 300m hurdles for girls U/14 in a record time of 51.35 seconds. She also set a record in the 90m hurdles for girls U/14 in a time of 15.18 seconds. Kailey’s two records did not last very long. On 18 February, she was in action again at the athletics meeting at Louis Trichardt High School. This event was also attended by PEPS, Mitchell House, Northern Academy, Ridgeway College, Frans du Toit High School and Tom Naudé High School. This time she ran the 300m hurdles in her age group in 49.22 seconds, while completing the 90m hurdles in another record time of 14.65 seconds. Kailey and the IsAbility Sport Club expressed their gratitude towards Louis Trichardt High School for affording her the opportunity to compete.
