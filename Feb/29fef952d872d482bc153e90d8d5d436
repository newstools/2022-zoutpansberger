History is about to be made on Friday (18th) when the first female chancellor of the University of Venda (Univen) will be installed. Advocate Mojanku Gumbi will be installed as the sixth chancellor of the university during a function at the university’s auditorium. Gumbi has more than 30 years of experience in private practice, public policy development and African conflict resolution. She is a human rights lawyer, who has worked as both an attorney and advocate. She holds law degrees from the University of Limpopo (former University of the North) and the University of the Witwatersrand, as well as a certificate in Trial Advocacy from the University of Texas in Austin. Gumbi serves and has served on the boards of many companies, trusts and philanthropic foundations, including the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, the Open Society Foundation, the Southern African Political and Economic Trust, the Black Lawyers Association, and the Thabo Mbeki Foundation. She also served on the councils of the former University of the North (now the University of Limpopo) and the former Technikon of the Witwatersrand (which merged with the former Rand Afrikaans University in 2005 to form the University of Johannesburg. “We look forward to her leadership and guidance in the years to come. Her involvement with the university will certainly stand us in good stead,” said Univen’s vice-chancellor and principal, Dr Bernard Nthambeleni, earlier this week. Several high-profile dignitaries will attend Friday’s inauguration ceremony. Among the guests are former president Thabo Mbeki, the former Deputy Chief Justice of South Africa, Justice Dikgang Moseneke and the former Miss South Africa, Basetsana Kumalo.
