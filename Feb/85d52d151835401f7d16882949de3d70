The SPCA Louis Trichardt launched their ever popular annual Jailed & Bailed virtual fundraiser on Tuesday with 13 “hardened” jailbirds and their hairy, hooved, furry, and feathered pet friends now counting on the public to bail them out! “These (un)lucky individuals will be placed under (not so strict at all) house arrest from the 1st of February to the 13th of February 2022. If they make their bail of R5000, they will be able to be home in time for Valentine’s Day.  It's up to YOU to bail them out!” said local SPCA spokesperson Alicia Thomas. This year’s top “jailbird” will walk away with the prestigious Jailed & Bailed trophy and a well-deserved mid-week break for five nights and four people, sponsored by ATKV Eiland Resort & Spa. “Thank you, ATKV Eiland Resort & Spa!” said Alicia. This year’s jailbirds are Alicia Thomas & Charlotte wanted for “Hogs & Kisses”; Esté & Humphrey wanted for “Going BULL Monty”; Estelle & Jack wanted for “Being a smart A$$”; Kevin & Hennifer Lopez wanted for “Jaywalking”; Mareli & Ewe Hefner wanted for “Baaaaaaaaaaa-d Behaviour”; Marina & Al Capony wanted for “Saying FILLY things”; Maureen & Mojo wanted for “Letting the dogs out”; Nadia & Cluck Norris wanted for “Crossing the Road”; Rampie & Mila wanted for “Barking up the wrong tree”; Roeline & Lilly wanted for “Purrrrrrrrrrjury”; Sheetal & Luna wanted for “Living the PUG Life”; Stephan & Elvis wanted for “Leaving the Building”; and Verné & Misty wanted for “Having a bad HARE Day”. “All the best to our jailbirds. The competition is going to be fierce this year! Thank you for your commitment and enthusiasm to help us raise the much-needed funds for our animals,” said Alicia. Persons wanting to support their favourite jailbird can pay their bail into the SPCA account or bring the cash to the SPCA or directly pay it to the jailbird. The local SPCA’s banking details are Standard Bank, account number 282 374 631, branch code 05 25 49. “Please make sure your reference includes ‘J&B’ AND the name of the jailbird AND your name,” said Thomas. This year’s Jailed & Bailed winner will be announced on Valentine’s Day. For more information, visit the SPCA Louis Trichardt Facebook page.
