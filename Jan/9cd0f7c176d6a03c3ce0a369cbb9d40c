The Zoutpansberger will again host our highly popular calendar photo competition, but unlike previous years, the region’s photographers will not have to wait until the end of the year to enter. Local photographers will now have until the last week of every month to submit their pictures, from which one monthly winner will be selected. This means that, in total, 12 winning photographs will be chosen with R600 prize money up for grabs for each winning entry. This month’s competition will close on January 31. Photographers can enter every month, but can only submit a maximum of five photographs each month. As usual, the photos will be judged on their uniqueness relating to the Soutpansberg. This may include unique places of interest, nature and wildlife photographs. Technical aspects such as lighting, sharpness and composition will also be taken into consideration. Please note that the photos must have been taken in die Soutpansberg area (but also including the Kruger National Park) during the last 24 months. It must also be the photographers own work. Only high-resolution digital photos (preferably in landscape format) will be accepted (including high-quality cellphone photos). The photos can be emailed to news@zoutnet.co.za, or submitted to the office of the Zoutpansberger at 16B Joubert Street, Louis Trichardt, on a memory stick or CD/DVD. Please do not resize photos to a smaller format. Included with the entry must be the photographer’s name and surname, what camera was used and where was the photo taken. At the end of the year, the 12 winning entries will be used to print a large-format photo calendar for 2023. The calendar will be used for marketing purposes by the newspaper. Accompanying photos are some more entries for January. For more information, phone Andries at Tel (015) 516 4997 or 082 603 2419 during office hours.
