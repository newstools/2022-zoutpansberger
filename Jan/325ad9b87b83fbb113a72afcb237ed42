Just more than a month has passed since the break-in at the Musina Post Office, and the community is still waiting for services to resume. Thugs broke into the post office on 16 December last year, stealing all the equipment and systems that enable the post office to be fully operational. “These burglars have tried to break into the post office on several occasions and have destroyed the outside structure of the building a number of times,” said Mr Mulaudzi Mmbengini, the manager of Musina Post Office. According to him, no security guards are available during the day or night to guard the building. The only time security guards are made available are on the days when pensioners get paid out. For the moment, Mmbengini said, the post office only did renewals of SASSA cards, and the community could collect their mail. He was not sure when normal services might resume. “This has really affected the whole of Musina,” said Peter Jack Mokgoli, chairperson of Musina To The Front, a local community structure. “Many residents cannot afford to travel the 100km to Louis Trichardt to collect their money. Most of them have resorted to waiting for their local post office to reopen all services.” Mokgoli said he was planning an urgent meeting with the post office’s management and Musina stakeholders. “If we all agree, we could try to rope in Venetia Mine to assist us with resources, in order for the post office to resume much-needed services to the public,” said Mokgoli.
