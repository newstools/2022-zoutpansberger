After a long break due to the restrictions brought about the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic, Parkrun South Africa has announced the restarting of their weekly events. Regarding this, Louis Trichardt’s weekly Parkrun will restart on Saturday, 7 May. A communique circulated to Parkrun members states that many may feel a bit nervous to restart. To ease fears, Parkrun South Africa urges organisers again to read through their Covid-19 framework that has been supporting their 5km and junior events for some time now. They state that they will continue to operate under these guidelines until they are confident that removing them permanently has become appropriate. These guidelines include that all individuals taking part in the event must make sure that they are Covid-19 symptom-free before attending the event and that hand sanitisers must be used before and during the event. Scanning and timing must now be done using the Virtual Volunteer App, not the physical scanners and timers, and organisers must note that they also require a ratio of one scanning volunteer to 50 predicted finishers at 5km events. The Soutpansberg Athletics Club hosts the local Parkrun, in conjunction with the Soutpansberg Chamber of Commerce. The race will start at 08:00 at the Tourism Information Centre. For more information about the event, phone Jaco (Chamber of Commerce) at Tel 084 616 2299 or Ferreira Nel (SPB Athletics Club) at Tel ‎082 749 0413.
