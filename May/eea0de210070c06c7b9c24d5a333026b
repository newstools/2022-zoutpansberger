Heaven is my home now and this is where I'll stay. I'm where I belong. I want you to be happy and try to be strong. Don't cry for me, it was just my time, but I will see you someday on the other side. I am not alone; the angels are with me to welcome me home. I have neither fear nor pain, Jesus took my tears. This is not the end, I'll be waiting here for you, till we meet again,” reads Willie’s funeral letter. The late Willie Venter is survived by his loving wife Macklin, daughters Charlotte, Rita and Poppy and six grandchildren.
