The Vhembe District will soon be honoured to host Louzanne Coetzee, one of the country’s Tokyo 2020 Paralympic silver and bronze medallists, courtesy of the IsAbility Sports Club Limpopo. “Her visit is scheduled for 12 to 14 May 2022. Louzanne is a visually impaired athlete (totally blind) who is also House Mistress at the University of the Free State. She is currently on the SASCOC commission as the SASCOC athletes representative,’ said Sandy James of the IsAbility Sports Club. The purpose of Louzanne’s visit is to enhance awareness of the opportunities for visually impaired athletes, as well as able-bodied athletes who can train to become guide runners. She will also give some basic training to local guide runners and visually impaired athletes, and she will also share a message of inspiration to motivate local communities. As part of Louzanne’s programme, she will visit Laerskool Louis Trichardt on Saturday, 14 May, from 09:00 to 12:00.  “During this time, she will be doing a demonstration of techniques and coaching some visually impaired athletes and guide runners. There are incredible opportunities for able-bodied athletes in terms of guide-running, and we hope this event will open up awareness of these opportunities and inspire those who have a future in this direction. She is also giving a motivational talk to senior learners at Emmanuel School on Friday, 13 May, from 12:00 to 13:00, where we have invited learners from the local town schools as well,” said James. All visually impaired athletes who would like to attend and are not connected to any school are also welcome to attend. “Many athletes get lost from the system when they leave school - and so we don't want anyone to feel left out or to feel they missed the opportunity,” said James. If anyone is interested in attending the Saturday (14 May) event, they can contact Sheryl James on 083 415 7056 or Sandy James at 084 506 3333, or email them at is.ability.limpopo@gmail.com.
