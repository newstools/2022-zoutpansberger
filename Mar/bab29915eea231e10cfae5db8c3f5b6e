Family and friends said a sad farewell to 63-year-old Erich Swoboda, who passed away on 17 March after a two-and-a-half-year battle against colon cancer. “You were the most amazing person and the light of many lives. We will miss you more than words can say: Till we meet again,” was the farewell message from brother Dion and fellow family members. Erich moved to Louis Trichardt from Germiston in the early 2000s and mostly focussed on his woodworking career, both making en restoring furniture for clients. “Working with wood was his passion,” said Dion. Apart from woodworking, Erich also helped brother Dion from DRS Security, mostly with the company signage. Erich was not only a gifted carpenter, but also a gifted artist. Erich was diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago. The cancer then spread to his liver. His passing was especially emotional for Dion, with whom Erich stayed for 13 years until his death. Erich’s memorial service will be held in the Agapé Christian Centre in Louis Trichardt on Thursday, 24 March, at 11:00 by Pastor Chris Mattheus. The family thanked all who had supported Erich in his sickness, as well as the family after his passing. “Lord, hear my own prayers for peace and redemption. Release me from this pain and suffering. Take me Home… Forgive me my sins. Grant my total healing, body and soul. Thank You, Jesus,” was Erich’s prayer. “Erich, God heard your prayers and now you are healed and have peace with Him,” said the family.
