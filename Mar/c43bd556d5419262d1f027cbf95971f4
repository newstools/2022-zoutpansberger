Makhado Municipality’s mayor, Samuel Munyai, has urged his management team to fill all the vacant positions at the municipality. During a recent strategic session, the mayor emphasised that these positions need to be filled to ensure the effective rendering of services. The municipality held a week-long strategy session at the Tshipise Aventura Resort a fortnight ago. During this session, Munyai stressed that they are working towards achieving a clean audit. When addressing the councillors and administrative management team, Munyai said that the municipality had the potential to achieve such an audit opinion in the 2021/22 financial year. Last year, the municipality achieved an unqualified opinion from the auditor-general, but this can be improved on, he said. Munyai also urged all municipal employees to be committed and execute their responsibilities with dedication. In his progress report, he said that several projects were underway in various parts of the municipality. All projects are progressing very well. These include the construction of the Lutanandwa bridge, the Tshedza-to-Vuvha tar road and the Sane-to-Natali bridge.
