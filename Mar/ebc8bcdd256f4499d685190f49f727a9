The Makhado Municipality said this week that they were definitely not proud of the deplorable state of the municipal cemetery in Louis Trichardt. “Obviously, the municipality can't derive pride and satisfaction from such state of affairs. That's why we're doing almost everything possible to preserve and restore the dignity of our cemetery,” said municipal spokesperson Mr Louis Bobodi. He was reacting to questions on the sad state of this municipal cemetery in last week’s Zoutpansberger. The sorry state of the municipal cemetery is nothing new and it has shown a steady decline over the last couple of decades. The past couple of weeks, family members who wanted to pay their respects to a deceased loved one found doing so difficult as the cemetery was completely overgrown, with only the top of the tombstone sticking out above the grass. It also seems that the cemetery has now become part of the municipal grazing camp, with herds of cattle frequently found inside the cemetery, urinating, defecating and trampling on graves. This is because almost nothing is left of the concrete fence erected around the cemetery during the 2009/10 financial year, at huge cost. “The recent and continuous rains and the unexpected breaking down of equipment had contributed to the current state of affairs, but we have arrested the situation now as we are using the available budget to purchase new equipment and to fix the broken ones,” said Bobodi in his response. He added that the municipality’s Department of Community Services had since been activated to put an end to the deplorable state of affairs. “Weather permitting, the cemetery will be at a desirable state of affairs by the end of next month,” said Bobodi.
