After a two-year absence because of the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic, the Soutpansberg will once again play host to the popular Kremetart Cycling Race this Saturday, 11 June. This year, the event will celebrate its “delayed” 30th anniversary, with the main event being the 175km stage race around the Soutpansberg. The main sponsor is once again ZZ2. Apart from the 175km race, a shorter 70km road race will also be held, as well as a 35km road race for the less fit. All three races will be decided on Saturday, with all races starting and finishing at the sports grounds (Leeupark) of Louis Trichardt High School in Ruh Street (next to the Soutpansberg Golf Club). According to the race organisers, some 650 cyclists are expected to enter for the different races, the bulk of whom (about 450) will be competing in the 175km race. This race is set to once again attract some of the top pro-cyclists in South African road-bike racing circles. Among those to look out for are Louis Trichardt’s own Daan Terblanche and pro-cyclist Kombo Bere. They have been practising around the clock for the last couple of weeks for the 175km race. Thus far, some 100 cyclists entered for the 70km event and 70 for the 35km event. Apart from the day’s main races, the Kremetart will once again put huge emphasis on early childhood development of the sport with the help of the very popular Kremetart Kiddies Race. This year, big prizes are to be won, including 20 vouchers of R500 to be spent at selected cycling shops. The Kiddies Race will start at 12:00 (also at Leeupark) and moms and dads can come and enter their children between 10:00 and 12:00 on the day of the race. But please remember, no helmet, no ride! Because of the different starting and finishing times of the different races on the day, residents will unfortunately have to endure road closures. For the start of the 175 race, part of Anderson Street and the whole of Stubbs Street to the N1 traffic circle will be closed from 06:00 to 08:30 on the day of the race, and for the stage from Louis Trichardt to Waterpoort, roads affected by this closure include the Witvlag and Bluegumspoort turn-offs (06:00 to 09:00), the Dzanani/Nzhelele turn-off (06:00-09:00) and the Musina/Waterpoort turn-off (06:00 to 11:00). The R521 (Alldays to Vivo road) will be closed from 09:00 to 14:00 (road regulated), with the Buysdorp/Tshikwarani road being closed from 09:00 to 16:00 (road regulated). The Schoemansdal/Louis Trichardt road will be closed from 08:00 to 17:30, again with the road being regulated. As for Louis Trichardt itself, Rissik Street, from the entrance from Vivo to Anderson Street will be closed during the day, as well as Anderson Street between Rissik and Ruh Street. The important times are between 05:00 and 10:30 and again from 14:30 to 17:00 for the start and finish of the different races. The rest of the day, these streets will be regulated. The Kremetart weekend’s festivities will already kick-off at 12:00 on Friday, 10 June, at Leeupark. Lots of food stalls, as well as a restaurant, beer garden and Kids Zone will be available. Entry at the gate in Ruh Street will cost you R30. On-site parking is available at R20 per vehicle. Later that evening, a concert by Elvis Blue will take place. Tickets for the event cost R100 per adult and R50 for primary school children and are not covered by the R30 entry fee. Elvis Blue tickets must be bought from the school, and for more information regarding this, phone Madeleine Nel at tel. 083 388 7933. The food stalls and festivities will continue throughout the day on Saturday. The weekend’s events will conclude on Saturday evening with the main prize-giving function, dinner and live entertainment. For the first time ever, the CVO School Zoutpansberg will be in charge of the by-now well-known potjiekos dinner that evening.
